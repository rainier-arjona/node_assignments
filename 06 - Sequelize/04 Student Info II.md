**Estimated Time to Completion:** 2-3 hours

**Level of Complexity:** Medium

**Instructions**

1. Read through the directions below. Note: You will be provided with any necessary files on which to work.
2. Complete the necessary elements as outlined.
3. Submit your GitHub URL with the completed code by the due date.

**Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**

- **Implement basic CRUD operations (Create and Delete) using Sequelize ORM.**
- **Develop a simple web interface using Express to interact with the database.**
- **Validate functionality through form submissions and database changes.**

**Directions**

**1. Project Setup**

- Initialize a new Node.js project and install required dependencies (express, sequelize, and a suitable database adapter like mysql2).

**2. Database Configuration**

- Configure Sequelize:
    - Set up Sequelize to connect to your database and test the connection to ensure it is working properly.

**3. Model Definition**

- Define a Model:
    - We will be using the data from our first assignment `Student Info I` with the `students_db` schema.

**4. Build API Endpoints**

- Create API Endpoints:
    - *POST /students:* Create a new student record based on the data submitted through a form.
    - *DELETE /students/:id:* Delete a student record by ID.

**5. Web Interface**

- Create Forms:
    - *Student Creation Form:* Design a form to allow users to create a new student. The form should include fields for `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `age`.
    - Implement a button next to each student record in the table that allows users to delete the student. This button should submit a form to the `/students/delete/:id` endpoint.

**6. Validation and Testing**

- Validate Functionality:
    - Ensure that the forms correctly create and delete student records.
    - Test the application using a web browser to ensure the API endpoints and forms work as expected.

**MVP Requirements**

- **Student Creation Form:** Implement a form that allows users to create a new student record.
- **Student Deletion Form:** Implement a form that allows users to delete a student record by ID.
- **API Endpoints:** Implement the necessary endpoints to handle form submissions.

**Expected Outputs**

- **Web Interface:** Functional forms for creating and deleting student records.
- **Database:** Verify that new student records are created and existing records are deleted in the database.

**Additional Notes**

- Ensure that you handle errors gracefully, both on the server-side and client-side.
- Include any relevant screenshots or exports showing the web application in action.
