### Assignment: Note Taking App (MVC with Sequelize)

In this assignment, you will enhance the Note Taking App by restructuring your application into an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and integrating Sequelize for database management. This will involve organizing your application code into distinct components to improve maintainability and scalability while using Sequelize to handle data storage and retrieval.

**Estimated Time to Completion:** 90 minutes

**Level of Complexity:** Medium

**Instructions**

1. Review the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and Sequelize ORM to understand how they can be applied to your existing application.
2. Refactor your application from Part 2 to follow the MVC pattern. This involves separating your routes, business logic, and data management into different modules and using Sequelize to interact with your database.
3. Test your refactored application to ensure that it still functions correctly and meets all the requirements from Part 2.
4. Submit your GitHub URL with the completed code by the due date.

**Evaluation Criteria & Learning Objectives**

- **Implement the MVC pattern to organize code effectively:** Develop a modular application structure using Models, Views, and Controllers to separate concerns.
- **Use Sequelize to manage database interactions:** Leverage Sequelize ORM for database operations and integrate it into your MVC architecture.
- **Refactor routes, controllers, and models to handle CRUD operations:** Update your application to follow the MVC pattern and ensure that CRUD operations are properly handled.
- **Ensure application functionality is preserved after refactoring:** Verify that the application continues to work as expected after restructuring.

**Directions**

Transform the API routes from Part 2 into an MVC architecture with Sequelize integration. Your application should be modularized into Models, Views, and Controllers, and should use Sequelize to interact with the database.

***MVP Requirements: MVC Structure with Sequelize***

1. **Models**
    - **Create a `noteModel.ts` file** to manage note data using Sequelize. Define a `Note` model with appropriate fields and methods for CRUD operations.
        
        Example methods in `noteModel.ts` might include:
        
        - `findAllNotes()`
        - `findNoteById(id)`
        - `createNote(noteData)`
        - `updateNote(id, updateData)`
        - `deleteNoteById(id)`
2. **Controllers**
    - **Create a `noteController.ts` file** to handle incoming requests and interact with the model. This file should include methods to process requests and return appropriate responses.
        
        Example methods in `noteController.ts` might include:
        
        - `getNotes(req, res)`
        - `getNoteById(req, res)`
        - `createNote(req, res)`
        - `updateNote(req, res)`
        - `deleteNoteById(req, res)`
3. **Routes**
    - **Update your route definitions in a `noteRoutes.ts` file** to use the methods defined in the controller.
        
        Example routes in `noteRoutes.ts` might include:
        
        - `router.get('/notes', noteController.getNotes)`
        - `router.get('/notes/:id', noteController.getNoteById)`
4. **Main Application**
    - In your main application file (e.g., `server.ts`), set up Express to use the routes defined in `noteRoutes.ts` and configure Sequelize to connect to your database.
        
        ```tsx
        /src
          /controllers
            noteController.ts
          /models
            noteModel.ts
          /routes
            noteRoutes.ts
          server.ts
        
        ```
        

**Expected Outputs**

- **`GET /notes:`** Render a list of all notes as an HTML page.
- **`GET /notes/add:`** Render a form to add a new note as an HTML page.
- **`POST /notes:`** Handle form submission to create a new note and redirect to the notes list.
- **`GET /notes/:id/edit:`** Render a form to edit an existing note as an HTML page.
- **`PUT /notes/:id:`** Handle form submission to update a note and redirect to the updated note view.
- **`DELETE /notes/:id:`** Handle note deletion and redirect to the notes list.

**Stretch Requirements**

- **Implement validation and error handling** in the model and controller layers.
